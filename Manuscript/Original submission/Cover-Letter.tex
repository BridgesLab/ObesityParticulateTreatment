\opening{Greetings,} % eg Hello.

Please find enclosed our manuscript \textbf{"Exposure to environmentally persistent free radicals during gestation lowers energy expenditure and impairs skeletal muscle mitochondrial function in adult mice"} by Stephenson \textit{et al.} for consideration by AJP Endocrinology and Metabolism.  We would like this study to be considered under the \emph{Mitochondrial Dynamics and Oxidative Stress in Disease} call for papers.

In this work, we describe and important and novel role of mitochondrial dysfunction early in development which results in chronic metabolic abnormalities in offspring.  To evaluate our paper we suggest the following reviewers be consulted.

\begin{itemize}
\item Staci Bilbo, Duke University %(staci.bilbo@duke.edu)
\item Carey Lumeng, University of Michigan %(clumeng@umich.edu)
\item Sanjay Rajagopalan, University of Maryland %(srajagopalan@medicine.umaryland.edu )
\item Qinghua Sun, Ohio State University %(qsun@cph.osu.edu)
\end{itemize}

Thank you for your consideration and please contact us if we can assist you further in the review process.
